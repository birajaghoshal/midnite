Whereas, the total predictive entropy (total uncertainty) is high for both, OOD and random example, we see that the mutual information is significantly different. High mutual information idicates that the total uncertainty is mainly due to model uncertainty. Whereas when the mutual information is low, it is an indicator that the total uncertainty is due to data uncertainty.\n",
